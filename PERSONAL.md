** General Expectations for Dylan **
1. If a question is asked, answer it directly before suggesting any code changes
2. Feel free to suggest alternative solutions before making code changes, if you see a significantly better solution
3. Similarly, call out any incorrect assumptions I may be making
4. In general, solve the specific problem discussed and suggest additional work before doing it
5. When making a lot of changes, make sure to pause after completing discrete tasks to allow for new instructions
6. Focus on completing the specific task requested. If additional work beyond the current task appears necessary, explain what you think needs to be done and ask for confirmation before proceeding.
7. Avoid making assumptions about what else might need to be changed.
8. Unless another database engine is specified, assume we're working on Snowflake
